                                   Food is one of the basic necessities of life. It contains nutrients—substances essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes. 

                                   Food is a substance consumed by humans and other organisms to provide nutritional support and energy. Nutrients which are chemical substances found in food provide the energy our bodies need to function. 
                                   
                                   The energy in food is measured in units called calories. Age, sex, weight, height, and level of activity determine the number of calories a person needs each day. Depending on age, sex, and activity level, the recommended daily caloric intake for a child aged 11 to 14 can range anywhere from 1,600 to 2,600 calories per day, with sedentary girls needing the fewest calories and active boys needing the most. For adults, this can range from 1,800 to about 3,000 calories .
                                   
                                   Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals and water.
                                    
                                   Water is found in many foods and has been defined as a food by itself. However, Water and fiber have low energy densities, or calories, while fat is the most energy-dense component.
                                   
                                   A food substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. It can be raw, processed, or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth, health, or pleasure.

                <p class="related-routine">
                  In our previous posts, we were able to discuss the macronutrients in food. 
                  The three macronutrients in food also called “macrotrio” are basically the nutrient the body needs the most and in large quantity too because their functions are enormous from energy production to tissue supports and repair and so on. 
                  In this article we shall be reviewing the macronutrients and their role in the body for a better health. 
                  Of course when we say better health we mean a situation where the body can function properly. 
                  Like the saying goes make food thy medicine and medicine thy food- if you eat right definitely you will be free from the hospital.
